    "title": "Does Stephen Curry Have the Best MVP Season of all Time?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Stephen Curry was the first player in NBA history to be voted a unanimous MVP for his 2015-2016 season. Does this mean that he had the best MVP season of all time, or were other players numbers down that season blasting his into proportion?\nIt is no question that Curry had an amazing season that was deserving of an MVP trophy, but the voting being unanimous raises the discussion of if that season was the best MVP season in NBA history. Let’s look at some data.\nA large part of winning an MVP award is scoring, but what makes a season truly special is the ability for the player to score at a high level while still play making. Was Curry just a scorer or was he getting his teammates involved as well?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nmvps &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC350/Blog/posts/Curry/mvpyearsfinal.csv\")\n\nplaymakers &lt;- mvps |&gt; filter(PTS &gt; 30.0, AST &gt; 6.0)\ncurry &lt;- mvps |&gt; filter(FT == \"0.908\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=mvps, aes(x=PTS, y=AST), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=playmakers, aes(x=PTS, y=AST), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=curry, aes(x=PTS, y=AST), color=\"blue\") +\n   geom_text_repel(\n    data=playmakers,\n    aes(x=PTS, y=AST, label=Player), nudge_y = .9\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Points Per Game\",\n    y=\"Assists Per Game\",\n    title=\"Curry Was Not Just Scoring, He Was Playmaking\",\n    subtitle=\"Stephen Curry Was Assisting the Ball at a High Level Along With Scoring at a High Level\",\n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Jack Bauer\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurry has always been known as one of the best three point shooters of all time, and an efficient shooter in general. A high point per game total stands out much more when it comes with efficiency. His 2015-2016 season is the only season in NBA history where a player shot 50/40/90 while averaging 30 points per game.\nLet’s see where that stacks up against other MVP seasons in history.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nmvps &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC350/Blog/posts/Curry/mvpyearsfinal.csv\")\n\nmodern &lt;- mvps |&gt; filter(ThreePCT &gt; 0)\ncurry &lt;- mvps |&gt; filter(FT == \"0.908\")\nmostefficient &lt;- modern |&gt; filter(\n  PTS &gt; 25,\n  FG &gt; .50,\n  ThreePCT &gt; .40\n)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=modern, aes(x=FG, y=ThreePCT, size=PTS), color=\"grey\", alpha = .5) +\n  geom_point(data=mostefficient, aes(x=FG, y=ThreePCT, size=PTS), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=curry, aes(x=FG, y=ThreePCT, size=PTS), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.510475  ) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.333675  ) +\n  scale_size(range = c(3, 8), name = \"Points Per Game\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=mostefficient,\n    aes(x=FG, y=ThreePCT, label=Player),  nudge_y = .08\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Field Goal Percentage\",\n    y=\"Three Point Percentage\",\n    title=\"Curry Was Efficient At Scoring From All Three Levels\",\n    subtitle=\"Stephen Curry Displayed a High Shooting Percentage From Two Point and Three Point Range\",\n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Jack Bauer\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWin shares and win shares per 48 are great statistics to show how much a player was contributing to their team’s success. Win shares are calculated by taking the player’s total points scored and points allowed compared to the league average, and then distributing the team’s wins by those numbers. Win shares per 48 is a more detailed way to explain win shares, it takes win shares and turns it into a per 48 minute per game statistic.\nPlayers with high win shares per 48 were contributing tp their team’s success every moment they were on the court. Let’s see who the leaders are throughout history.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nmvps &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC350/Blog/posts/Curry/mvpyearsfinal.csv\")\nthirtyppg &lt;- mvps |&gt; filter(PTS &gt; 30) |&gt; arrange(desc(WSperfourtyeight))\n\nthirtyppg |&gt;\n  select(Player, Season, PTS, WS, WSperfourtyeight) |&gt;  \n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    PTS = \"Points Per Game\",\n    WS = \"Win Shares\",\n    WSperfourtyeight = \"Win Shares Per Fourty Eight\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Curry Was Largely Contributing to The Warriors Win Total\",\n    subtitle = \"Stephen Curry's Win Shares and Win Shares Per Fourty Eight Numbers Are Very High\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Jack Bauer  |  **Source:** Sports Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Stephen Curry\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurry Was Largely Contributing to The Warriors Win Total\n\n\nStephen Curry's Win Shares and Win Shares Per Fourty Eight Numbers Are Very High\n\n\nPlayer\nSeason\nPoints Per Game\nWin Shares\nWin Shares Per Fourty Eight\n\n\n\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar\n1971-72\n34.8\n25.4\n0.340\n\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar\n1970-71\n31.7\n22.3\n0.326\n\n\nMichael Jordan\n1990-91\n31.5\n20.3\n0.321\n\n\nStephen Curry\n2015-16\n30.1\n17.9\n0.318\n\n\nMichael Jordan\n1995-96\n30.4\n20.4\n0.317\n\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander\n2024-25\n32.7\n16.7\n0.309\n\n\nMichael Jordan\n1987-88\n35.0\n21.2\n0.308\n\n\nKevin Durant\n2013-14\n32.0\n19.2\n0.295\n\n\nJames Harden\n2017-18\n30.4\n15.4\n0.289\n\n\nOscar Robertson\n1963-64\n31.4\n20.6\n0.278\n\n\nWilt Chamberlain\n1965-66\n33.5\n21.4\n0.275\n\n\nMichael Jordan\n1991-92\n30.1\n17.7\n0.274\n\n\nJoel Embiid\n2022-23\n33.1\n12.3\n0.259\n\n\nWilt Chamberlain\n1959-60\n37.6\n17.0\n0.245\n\n\nBob McAdoo\n1974-75\n34.5\n17.8\n0.242\n\n\nRussell Westbrook\n2016-17\n31.6\n13.1\n0.224\n\n\nMoses Malone\n1981-82\n31.1\n15.4\n0.218\n\n\nAllen Iverson\n2000-01\n31.1\n11.8\n0.190\n\n\n\nBy: Jack Bauer | Source: Sports Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Curry finds himself towards the top of all of these charts, but does that mean he had the best season ever?
